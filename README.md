# Bookstore Database Project

This project involves designing and implementing a relational database system for a bookstore using MySQL. It is a group project aimed at demonstrating database design, normalization, SQL scripting, and schema documentation.

---

## Tools Used
-**DB Fiddle** -Used initially for schema creation ,testing and validation
- **MySQL** – For creating and managing the database.
- **Draw.io** – For designing the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram).
- **GitHub** – For version control and collaboration.

---

## Key Features

- Structured relational schema including:
  - Customers
  - Authors
  - Books
  - Orders
  - Payments
  - Order Details
  - Categories
- Well-defined **primary and foreign keys**.
- Proper use of **data types** and **constraints** to ensure data integrity.
- Modular script for creating the full schema (`bookstore_schema.sql`).
